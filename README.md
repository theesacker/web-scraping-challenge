# web-scraping-challenge
For this project we were supposed to create a website that would use Chromedriver to access four different websites and gather results. I gathered a news title/article from one site, a featured image from a second, a fact table about Mars from another, gathered images of the Hemispheres from a fourth. All of these were stored as variables that could be accessed when we created a site. Once those variables were stored, I then created a second Python sheet that connected to a NoSQL, MongoDB and created a local website that would create all the scraping and displayed them. 

Unfortunately, I had been having issues with the Flask app that generated the local site and wasnâ€™t able to load the module. It would error out saying that no such module exists, then would show as already installed when I would try to re-install it. I feel confident I would be able to properly execute and run the code if I had not had these issues.
